# Assignment: Portfolio Website (Python Web Development)

A website to show off your skills and the things you've built.

## Instructions

Using what you have learnt about web development, build your own portfolio website.

This can be designed any way you want. It's the place to show off your skills and the things you've built.

Take inspiration from other developers (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/) but try not to copy their designs. Because this is about showing off what you can do!

Use what you've learnt from Day 65 and plan out your website. Think about design, UI, UX, colour schemes, fonts. Don't build the website for other people, build it to make yourself proud.

If you want, deploy and host the website to share with other students so we can admire your hard work!
